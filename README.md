In this revised and completed project I hope to explain and provide insight into my team and I's creation of a Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe game.

This game builds on an earlier project this semester that begun converting the classic game into qubits, a quantum circuit and other quantum computing-based components. In this final variant, we created a more streamlined, expansive and efficient game that allows for superpositions, classical moves, collapsing and more.

There is also an accompanying poster regarding a presentation held for this project which can be found here
